This repository contains all code to reproduce the simulation results in Knowlton & Parast, L. (2026). Assessing Surrogate Heterogeneity in Real World Data Using Meta-Learners. Journal of Causal Inference, In press.

To reproduce results, proceed through the following steps. Download all files in this repository and place them in a single folder. These include function files, helper files, and two main files. 
The two main files are: sims_obs_master_011725.R and sims_obs_readin.R. The files called sims_runX.R (Setting 1), sims_runX_2.R (Setting 2), sims_runX_3.R (Setting 3), and sims_runX_4.R (Setting 4) 
where X is a number, each run 50 iterations of the sims_obs_master_011725.R file. For Setting 1 for example, you will need to first change any parameter settings in cluster_1.R, then run all 20 files: sims_runX.R (designed to run in parallel);  this will write results to various files in the folder. Then use the sims_obs_readin.R file to read in all the results and create the table; make sure to set the setting and directory correctly at the top of the sims_obs_readin.R file. For Setting 2, you will change cluster_2.R and then run the 20 files sims_runX_2.R.
